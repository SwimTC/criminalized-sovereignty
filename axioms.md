# Axioms: Criminalized Sovereignty Project

These are working assumptions for this project. Draft and revisable.

1. Sovereignty includes both formal recognition and practical control over territory and population.
2. Some forms of organized violence (piracy, certain terror acts) can be treated as offenses against all states, not just one.
3. There is a meaningful difference between:
   - A state tolerating criminality.
   - A state structurally integrated with criminal organizations (a “narco-state”).
4. Classifying actors as *hostis humani generis* is a legal-political choice with consequences for jurisdiction, due process, and war/peace categories.
5. Any proposed framework should be usable by liberal-democratic states acting in alliances, not only through universal institutions.

Status: draft.
