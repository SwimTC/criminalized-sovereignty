Sovereignty, Deniability, and the Case for a Modern Hostis Humani Generis Doctrine
By: Tavis Campbell

Modern international law rests on a binary that no longer describes the world it is meant to govern. Violence is assumed to be either sovereign—authorized, attributable, and therefore regulated—or criminal—unauthorized, individual, and therefore punishable. That distinction once structured jurisdiction, war, and enforcement with tolerable clarity. Today it increasingly functions as a fiction. The most destabilizing actors in the international system operate precisely in the space between these categories, exploiting sovereignty as a shield while disavowing responsibility for the violence carried out in their name.

This is not a breakdown of order so much as an adaptation to its weaknesses. Proxy militias, cartel-states, deniable cyber operations, transnational criminal networks, and outsourced coercion are not aberrations. They are strategies that work because existing legal regimes treat attribution as optional and enforcement as consensual. The result is a system that punishes ownership of violence while rewarding deniability, mistaking paralysis for restraint and endurance for stability.

The core claim of this essay is straightforward. Sovereign immunity should attach only to acts genuinely performed in an official capacity. Where a head of state or senior official personally directs a continuous, transnational enterprise of private or deniable violence—while simultaneously disclaiming authorship—sovereignty ceases to function as a legitimate organizing principle and instead becomes a laundering mechanism for criminal power. In such cases, immunity should be forfeited through a narrow jurisdictional reclassification analogous to hostis humani generis, coupled with an enforcement ultimatum: either the host state arrests and surrenders the individual for prosecution, or other states may lawfully effect a targeted arrest notwithstanding territorial consent. Properly constrained, this doctrine would not collapse the international system into imperial free-for-all. It would close the gray-zone loopholes that currently destabilize it.

Sovereignty, in functional terms, is not a moral achievement but an allocation mechanism. It assigns a monopoly on force within a territory and, critically, responsibility for the violence that flows from that force. This responsibility is what makes sovereignty tolerable to others. It allows violence to be attributed, contested, deterred, or retaliated against within an intelligible framework. Sovereignty is therefore not merely control; it is control plus ownership.

Modern practice increasingly severs this link. States routinely claim monopoly on force while denying responsibility for actors they arm, direct, shelter, or coordinate. Militias become “volunteers.” Criminal organizations become “non-state actors.” Cyber units become “patriotic hackers.” Cartels become domestic law-enforcement problems whose international consequences are treated as unfortunate externalities. This language does not reflect loss of control. It reflects strategic abdication of responsibility.

Tolerating this contradiction does not preserve peace. It incentivizes the externalization of violence into deniable forms and encourages regimes to fragment authorship precisely to avoid accountability. The international system thereby selects for actors who govern through proxies and punishes those who act openly. This is not neutrality. It is structural bias in favor of criminalized sovereignty.

Existing legal mechanisms are poorly suited to this reality. International law condemns conduct but lacks compulsory enforcement. Its sanctions are reputational and slow, costs that strategically insulated actors are often willing to bear. The International Criminal Court can indict but cannot compel surrender; its jurisdiction depends on consent that is predictably withheld by those most likely to abuse deniability. Extradition regimes fail for the same reason. They assume good faith where it does not exist.

War, meanwhile, is the wrong instrument. It is collective, escalatory, and indiscriminate relative to the problem it seeks to address. Treating deniable criminal enterprises as conventional military adversaries conflates person-specific coercion with interstate conflict and imposes costs wildly disproportionate to the enforcement objective. The choice between impotence and war is a false one, created by doctrinal gaps rather than necessity.

International law has confronted a structurally analogous problem before. Piracy was designated hostis humani generis not because pirates were uniquely evil, but because they exploited jurisdictional seams in ways that rendered ordinary law ineffective. Pirates operated beyond territorial sovereignty, used flags opportunistically, and relied on deniability and mobility as core tactics. Universal jurisdiction did not arise from moral consensus; it arose from functional necessity.

The piracy doctrine worked because it was narrow and boring. It stripped immunity, authorized capture without consent, and attached jurisdiction to persons rather than territories. It did not authorize conquest, occupation, or governance. It closed a loophole and then stopped. Far from destabilizing the system, it stabilized trade and navigation by removing actors who thrived on legal ambiguity.

The lesson is structural. When private violence exploits sovereignty as cover while evading responsibility, the system must choose between preserving form and preserving function. Piracy demonstrates that carefully constrained exceptions can protect the rule by eliminating incentives for jurisdictional evasion.

Certain modern actors function in ways that are structurally indistinguishable from pirates. They direct continuous, transnational violence through private or deniable networks; they design operations to frustrate attribution; and they rely on territorial sovereignty to block enforcement while disavowing authorship. When a head of state or senior official personally exercises control over such enterprises, the problem is no longer one of state policy disagreement. It is one of criminalized authority.

This is where sovereign immunity fails. Immunity has always been conditional. Acts performed in an official capacity may be shielded; private, commercial, or criminal acts are not. This distinction is black-letter doctrine. What has been lacking is not legal theory, but willingness to treat deniable violence as disqualifying rather than tolerable.

A modern hostis humani generis designation should therefore operate as a jurisdictional reclassification applied to individuals, not states. It should attach only where an individual exercises personal, operational control over a continuous enterprise of transnational private violence that international law has never recognized as a legitimate sovereign function. The designation is not punitive. It does not condemn regimes or populations. It removes immunity barriers that otherwise prevent enforcement.

Crucially, designation must trigger an ultimatum rather than an abstraction. The territorial state in which the individual is present must be required to either arrest and surrender the individual to a recognized prosecuting jurisdiction, or demonstrate through transparent proceedings that the individual has been lawfully removed from authority and placed under effective domestic custody for prosecution. Failure to do so constitutes forfeiture of immunity with respect to enforcement actions narrowly directed at that individual.

This mechanism preserves sovereignty by making it conditional on responsibility. A state that complies retains its territorial integrity and legal standing. A state that refuses forfeits only the immunity shielding the designated individual. No occupation is authorized. No regime change is implied. Force, where used, is person-specific and limited to arrest.

The risk of abuse is real and should not be minimized. Any doctrine that authorizes cross-border enforcement will be used asymmetrically and contested politically. But the alternative is not neutrality; it is acquiescence to a system that already rewards the most destabilizing behavior. The relevant comparison is not between perfection and danger, but between constrained enforcement and unconstrained gray-zone violence.

Constraints therefore matter more than aspirations. Designation must be evidence-bound, public, and capable of adversarial testing. Intelligence assertions alone are insufficient. The doctrine must be reversible, contingent on behavior rather than status. Most importantly, it must apply symmetrically in principle, even if enforcement power remains unequal in fact. A rule that cannot theoretically apply to one’s own officials is not law but domination.

The strongest objection is that such a doctrine risks becoming imperial jurisdiction by prosecutorial assertion. That risk exists. But abstention does not eliminate it. It merely cedes the field to actors who already exploit deniability with impunity. The current system does not avoid power; it misallocates it.

The international order faces a forced choice. Either sovereignty remains absolute even when used to export criminal violence, or sovereignty becomes conditional on ownership of force and responsibility for its consequences. There is no stable middle ground. A modern hostis humani generis doctrine does not end sovereignty. It strips deniability of its protective value.

That move is not radical. It is conservative. It preserves the function of sovereignty by refusing to let its form be weaponized against the order it was meant to sustain.
