# Criminalized Sovereignty

Hostis humani generis, narco-states, and criminalized sovereignty.

## Core questions

- When, if ever, can drug cartels or terrorist groups be treated as *hostis humani generis*?
- What would that classification mean for narco-terror leadership and jurisdiction over them?
- How do we distinguish a legitimate theocracy from an illegitimate one?
- When does a state effectively become a narco-state?
- Is criminalized sovereignty still sovereignty at all, and what follows if not?

## Repository structure (planned)

- `sources/` – cases, statutes, history, theory.
- `derivations/` – working arguments on each core question.
- `syntheses/` – integrated essays/chapters.
- `axioms.md` – non‑negotiable assumptions for this project.
